# This is literally me going through Statistical Rethinking book (second edition)

Repository with exercises and code from the McElreath's Statistical Rethinking edition 2. 

I will structure it around chapters with code that reproduces the text in the chapters 
and exercises as I go through the book. 

Let's have a thoughtful fun time!
